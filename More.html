                                    trees in areas with few or no trees. This is so important because trees have a very
                                    important role to play in the support and existence of life of other living
                                    organisms on the earth. Trees provide fresh air enriched with oxygen gas which is
                                    essential in the breathing of all animals.</p>

                                    is not clear and conducive to human use. This means it will only be possible if most
                                    of our industries will in turn use energy from renewable sources of energy e.g solar
                                    energy by sunlight , biogas from animal dung, geothermal energy from earthen stem,
                                    windmill energy from wind , hydroelectric power from water.</p>

                        species that are at risk of extinction. This is all because of pollution caused by human beings.
                        Some of them have already vanished and there are high possibilities that there will be an
                        increase in the next 10 years to come.<br><br>Increase in the number of deaths both to animals
                        and human beings - From the statistics and facts above, we can clearly say that the increase in

                        is not only in people but also in other living organisms, animals and plants. All because of the
